# Specular exponent
# A high exponent results in a tight, concentrated highlight
# Values normally range from 0 to 1000
Ns 96.078431

# Ambient reflectivity
# normally in the range of 0.0 to 1.0
# Values outside this range increase or decrease the relectivity accordingly
Ka 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000

# Diffuse reflectivity
Kd 0.640000 0.640000 0.640000

# Specular reflectivity
Ks 0.500000 0.500000 0.500000

# Optical density, a.k.a. index of refraction
# Values can range from 0.001 to 10
# A value of 1.0 means that light does not bend as it passes through an object
# Increasing it increases the amount of bending
# Glass has an index of refraction of about 1.5
# Values of less than 1.0 produce bizarre results and are not recommended
Ni 1.000000

# Amount this material dissolves into the background
# A factor of 1.0 is fully opaque, default when a new material is created
# A factor of 0.0 is fully dissolved (completely transparent)
# Unlike a real transparent material, the dissolve does not depend upon material thickness
# nor does it have any spectral character
# Dissolve works on all illumination models
